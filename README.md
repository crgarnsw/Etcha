# Etcha

Etcha Sketch program with Hardware Controls

Two rotary encoders are attached to an Arduino, which interfaces to the PC.  I have written an Etcha Sketch example program, but it could also be Pong, missle command, ect.

The encoders that I use have an additional push button control that can be used like a trigger (I use it to change the colors that are being displayed).
